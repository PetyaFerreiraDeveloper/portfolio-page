                    <p>I am a self-taught frontend developer, who is really enjoying building web applications full time. I have a background in finance, strategy and accounting, which i must admit is not quite related to programming. <br> About 10 years ago, while looking for a business related work positions, I decided to try out a new study platform called Coursera. I loved the idea of top world universities offering education for free. Again not everyone can afford paying Stanford admission fees. <br>I took a computer science course in Coursera, just out of curiousity. Not long after I followed up with Python and Javascript, and I was loving it! I could spend hours and hours doing a challenge, without really feeling how the time passed by. <br>Until one day - voila I found a job in my formal field of study. Getting this job was, after all, what I have been studying and working for all my life. So I stopped exploring the IT development world and instead dived into the world of maximizing revenue and profits. I am very greatfull for the opportunity and experience I gained as a business oriented professional. I gave my best both at Scandic as a Revenue Manager and at Telenor as a Senior Value Management Consultant. During these years my passion for programming didn't dissappear though. In my jobs I was always attracted on taking projects and tasks, where I could build tools and financial models which were optimizing and automating the workflow for the whole department. <br> Ten years fast forward, we arrive in 2021, where I finally took the decision to stop my career within business and finance and work full time on becoming a software developer. It is, after all, never too late to change direction and pursue a <em>Dream!</em></p>
                    <p>I am using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS on a daily basis and have built several web applications. Check <a class="for-link" href="#projects"><em>my projects</em></a> page.</p>
